# Vicsek Model


The Vicsek model is a mathematical model that illustrates the collective motion of particles. The dynamics of the particles in them model depend on the particle density and instensity of noise in the system.

# Notes

-Periodic boundary conditions 

-Boundaries of box are assumed to be 1 so radius is between [0,1]
